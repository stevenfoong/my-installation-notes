pomerium - able to self host but close source , not consider  
  
OpenZiti - it is secure since netfoundry core business is network zero trust. i like it . but it is a bit overkill for my requirement. Should keep this in bookmark. Hopefully we can try it out in future. especially the SDK embedded.  
   
nebula - this develop & use by slack, it focus on connectivity with encryption . the encryption is from signal messenger. it use tinc for vpn and mesh routing. and it is develop using GO. So I decide to give it a try first.
